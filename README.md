# Tableparser

A gem for parsing table-like formats like from SQL output such as MySQL (when it's not batch-formatted).

```ruby
io = StringIO.new <<-EOS
+---------+---------+
| col1    | col2    |
+---------+---------+
| val     | val     |
| val     | val     |
+---------+---------+
EOS
Tableparser.parse(io)
# => [['col1', 'col2'], ['val', 'val'], ['val', 'val']]
```

It can also parse the content in to instances of a `Struct` class.

```ruby
MyRow = Struct.new(:col1, :col2)
Tableparser.parse_to_struct(io, MyRow)
# => [#<struct MyRow col1="val", col2="val">, #<struct MyRow col1="val", col2="val">]
```

Also comes with a handy `tableparser` exectuable:

```bash
$ echo "SELECT 1 AS one, 2 AS two" | mysql --table
+-----+-----+
| one | two |
+-----+-----+
|   1 |   2 |
+-----+-----+

$ echo "SELECT 1 AS one, 2 AS two" | mysql --table | tableparser
one,two
1,2
```
